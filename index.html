        Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain <em>Coffea</em> species. The location where the coffee tree is grown plays a role in the quality of the final cup. Regardless of where the trees are
        grown all fruit must be further processed from a raw materialâ€”the fruit and seedâ€”into a stable, raw product; un-roasted, green coffee. To process the berries, the seed is separated from the fruit to produce green coffee. Green coffee is then roasted,
        a process which transforms the raw product (green coffee) into a consumable product (roasted coffee). Roasted coffee is ground into a powder and mixed with water to produce a cup of coffee. <br /> Coffee is darkly colored, bitter, slightly acidic
        and has a stimulating effect in humans, primarily due to its caffeine content. It is one of the most popular drinks in the world, and can be prepared and presented in a variety of ways (e.g., espresso, French press, caffÃ¨ latte, or already-brewed
        canned coffee). It is usually served hot, although chilled or iced coffee is common. Sugar, sugar substitutes, milk or cream are often used to lessen the bitter taste. It may be served with coffee cake or another sweet dessert like doughnuts.
        A commercial establishment that sells prepared coffee beverages is known as a coffee shop
